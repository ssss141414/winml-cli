"""Unit tests for ``to_optimum_task`` — the single WinML -> Optimum collapse boundary.

``to_optimum_task`` is the relocated/renamed ``export.io.map_task_synonym``. It must
reproduce that behavior verbatim: WinML extensions short-circuit before Optimum, and
everything else passes through ``TasksManager.map_from_synonym`` (which collapses
modality-aware names like ``image-feature-extraction`` to ``feature-extraction``).
