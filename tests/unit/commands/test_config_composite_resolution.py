"""Composite resolution for `winml config` without an explicit ``--task`` (#850).

An encoder-decoder model built without ``--task`` must export the full
encoder+decoder composite, not a decoder-only half whose ``encoder_hidden_states``
input has no producer. The no-task path detects the task with the *same*
``detect_task`` that ``inspect`` uses, then expands to the registered composite when
the detected task is one that composite serves (so no-task routing matches explicit
``--task`` for the same model). A checkpoint whose detected task isn't a composite
task (sequence-classification BART, a T5 encoder, a CLIP) stays a single model,
consistent with ``inspect``.

The routing logic is exercised as a pure ``(model_type, detected_task)`` helper
(deterministic, offline); the full resolver is exercised with crafted real
architectures so detection runs for real without a network download.
