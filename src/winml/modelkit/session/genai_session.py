"""GenaiSession — onnxruntime-genai session for multi-model decoder pipelines.

Manages ``og.Model`` + ``og.Generator`` lifecycle for autoregressive text
generation.  Reuses :class:`WinMLEPRegistry` for EP discovery and registration
so EPs are downloaded / registered at most once per process.

Unlike :class:`WinMLSession` (which wraps ``ort.InferenceSession`` for
single-shot inference), ``GenaiSession`` drives a streaming token-by-token
generation loop.  The two classes are peers — neither inherits from the other.

Bundle directory layout expected by ``onnxruntime-genai``::

    <bundle_dir>/
        genai_config.json          ← required; controls pipeline & search
        ctx.onnx                   ← prefill transformer graph
        iter.onnx                  ← decode transformer graph
        embeddings.onnx            ← embedding lookup
        lm_head.onnx               ← logit projection
        tokenizer.json             ← HF tokenizer files
        tokenizer_config.json
        ...

Usage::

    # Context manager (recommended — auto-loads and unloads)
    with GenaiSession("out/qwen3_bundle", ep="qnn") as session:
        for token_str in session.generate_streaming("Hello, who are you?"):
            print(token_str, end="", flush=True)

    # Manual lifecycle
    session = GenaiSession("out/qwen3_bundle", ep="cpu")
    session.load()
    result = session.generate("What is a transformer?")
    session.unload()

Dependencies::

    pip install onnxruntime-genai-winml
    pip install "windowsml[with-ort]"   # registers QNN EP; also provides ORT

    Wraps ``og.Model`` + ``og.Generator`` to provide a clean generation API.

    The session is **stateless across calls**: each :meth:`generate_streaming`
    call creates a fresh ``og.Generator`` so KV state does not persist between
    prompts.  Thread-safety within a single session is not guaranteed.

    Args:
        bundle_dir: Path to the genai bundle directory.  Must contain
            ``genai_config.json`` and the ONNX files it references.
        ep: Execution-provider **override** (short alias such as ``"cpu"``,
            ``"qnn"``, ``"dml"``, or a full ``*ExecutionProvider`` name).  The
            precedence is **explicit arg > bundle config**:

            * ``None`` (default) — *respect the bundle config*.  EP registration
              and pre-compilation are decided from ``genai_config.json`` (per-stage
              ``session_options.provider_options``), exactly as the bundle
              author intended.
            * a concrete EP — *override the pipeline's execution provider*.
              ``"cpu"`` strips the hardware providers from every stage (CPU
              fallback, no WinML EP registration or compilation).  A hardware EP
              re-routes **only the stages that already run on a hardware EP**,
              leaving stages the bundle deliberately keeps on CPU (e.g.
              ``embeddings``/``lm_head``) untouched — forcing a large
              CPU-intended graph onto an accelerator is rarely wanted and can
              trigger very slow on-the-fly compilation.  A re-routed stage reuses
              the bundle's own options for the target EP when available (e.g. QNN
              ``backend_path``/``soc_model``, borrowed from any stage), otherwise
              synthesizes ``device_type`` from *device* for device-parameterized
              EPs (OpenVINO/VitisAI).

            The override is generic — validated against and rewritten from the
            shared EP union, with no hardcoded EP short-name → behavior map.  If
            the override matches no stage (flat/empty pipeline, or an all-CPU
            bundle) the run follows the bundle config and :attr:`effective_ep`
            reports ``None`` (the always-safe override direction is ``"cpu"``).
        device: Concrete target device (``"npu"``/``"gpu"``/``"cpu"``) the forced
            *ep* should run on.  Used only to synthesize ``device_type`` for
            device-parameterized EPs (OpenVINO/VitisAI) when a re-routed stage
            has no reusable options; ignored when respecting the bundle config.
        context_length: Override for the static KV cache length.  When
            ``None`` (default), read from ``genai_config.json``.
            Must match the ``--max-cache-len`` used during the winml-cli build.
        verbose: Enable ``onnxruntime-genai`` native model I/O logging.
        compile: Pre-compile EPContext-capable pipeline stages (e.g. QNN) to
            EPContext ONNX on first run (inside ``bundle_dir/_compiled/``).
            Subsequent calls reuse the cached EPContext files, eliminating
            per-run JIT overhead.  Only stages that the *effective* config (after
            any ``ep`` override) routes to an EPContext-capable EP and that can be
            compiled without hanging are attempted; stages that fail compilation
            fall back to the original ONNX.  A CPU-only (or CPU-forced) bundle is
            a no-op.
        compile_timeout: Maximum seconds to wait for each stage to compile
            before killing the subprocess and falling back to the original
            ONNX.  Defaults to 300 seconds (5 minutes).

        Some accelerator runtimes (notably QNN on the Hexagon NPU) fault during

        its weights ``.bin`` have already been flushed to disk. Judging success
        by exit code alone would then discard fully valid compiled work and fall
        back to a JIT compile of the original graph, which just repeats the same
        crashing native path at model-load time.

        The shared compiler first writes the EPContext under Onnx Runtime's auto
        name ``{src_stem}_<device>_ctx.onnx`` *next to the source model*, then
        copies it to *ctx_out*. A teardown crash can leave the artifact in either

        stage. The ``.bin`` keeps its name, so the graph's ``ep_cache_context``
        reference still resolves once both files sit in the compiled directory.

        A candidate is *fresh* only if this compile actually produced it: a path
        already present before the subprocess started (``pre_compile_mtimes``)
        must have advanced its modification time, otherwise it is a stale

        The provider / device token in the auto name is matched with a wildcard,
