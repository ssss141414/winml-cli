# winml sys

> Inspect your machine — devices, EPs, and runtime versions at a glance.

## When to use this

Run `winml sys` before starting any export or build workflow to confirm that the
required ML libraries are installed and that the target hardware is visible. It is
also the first command to run when diagnosing an unexpected export failure.

## Synopsis

```bash
$ winml sys [options]
```

## Flags

| Flag | Short | Type | Default | Description |
|------|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--format` | `-f` | `text` \| `json` \| `compact` | `text` | Output format. `text` renders rich tables, `json` emits machine-readable JSON, `compact` prints a single-line summary. |
| `--list-device` | — | flag | `false` | List available compute devices (NPU, GPU, CPU) in priority order instead of showing the full system report. |
| `--list-ep` | — | flag | `false` | List available ONNX Runtime execution providers instead of showing the full system report. Can be combined with `--list-device`. |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | flag | `false` | Surface additional diagnostic sections: backend availability and Export Readiness. |
| `--help` | `-h` | flag | — | Show help and exit. |

> `winml sys` takes no `--model`, `--device`, `--ep`, `--task`, or `--precision`
> arguments. It describes the host environment, not a specific model.

## How it works

`winml sys` queries Python's `platform` and `importlib.metadata` modules to report
library versions, then probes PyTorch for CUDA availability and GPU device names.
Backend availability checks use the installed runtime environment, while device
enumeration queries hardware directly in NPU > GPU > CPU priority order, and EP
enumeration merges the WinML EP registry with ONNX Runtime's
`get_available_providers()`. When
`--format json` is used the full report — including devices and EPs — is emitted as
a single JSON object, making it easy to capture in CI pipelines.

## Examples

```bash
# Full human-readable system report
$ winml sys
```

```text

Environment
  Python Version    3.11.9
  Python Executable C:\...\python.exe
  OS                Windows 11
  Machine           AMD64

ML Libraries
  Library        Version   Status
  torch          2.4.0     OK
  transformers   4.44.0    OK
  onnx           1.16.1    OK
  ...

Available Devices (priority order)
  #1  NPU   Qualcomm(R) Hexagon NPU
  #2  GPU   Qualcomm(R) Adreno GPU
  #3  CPU   Snapdragon(R) X Elite

Available Execution Providers
  QNNExecutionProvider           -> NPU/GPU
  DmlExecutionProvider           -> GPU
  CPUExecutionProvider           -> CPU
```

```bash
# Compact one-liner — useful for CI logs
$ winml sys --format compact
```

```bash
# Machine-readable JSON — pipe to jq or save for later comparison
$ winml sys --format json > env.json
```

The full JSON report includes a schema version and installed physical memory:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "platform": {
    "system": "Windows",
    "release": "11",
    "machine": "ARM64"
  },
  "memory": {
    "physical_total_mib": 16384
  }
}
```

Memory capacity uses MiB. If the host does not expose the physical memory total,
the field is `null` and `winml sys` emits a warning while preserving the rest of
the system report.

```bash
# Only list devices — skip everything else
$ winml sys --list-device
```

```bash
# List EPs as JSON — useful for scripting EP selection
$ winml sys --list-ep --format json
```

## Common pitfalls

- **`--list-device` and `--list-ep` suppress the full report.** When either flag is
  present, only the requested section is printed. Omit both flags to see the
  complete system report.
- **`--format compact` omits device and EP tables.** The compact format is designed
  for single-line log entries and does not include device or EP details. Use `text`
  or `json` when you need the full picture.
- **CUDA shown as unavailable on a machine with a GPU.** PyTorch must be installed
  with CUDA support (`torch+cuXXX`). A CPU-only torch wheel will always report
  `cuda_available: false`.
