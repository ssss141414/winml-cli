**Windows ML CLI** is a command line tool for building **portable, performant, and high-quality** AI models for Windows ML. It takes you from a source model — whether from Hugging Face or your own pipeline — to a hardware-optimized artifact in a reproducible workflow.

Purpose-built for Windows hardware diversity, the CLI handles conversion, graph optimization, and compilation across AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm targets. The CLI fits naturally into CI/CD pipelines so teams can validate and ship models easily.

## What you can do

- **Build once, run across hardwares.** Compose your own workflow from primitive commands (`export`, `analyze`, `optimize`, `quantize`, `compile`), or use an auto-generated config with `winml build` - both produce portable models that run across hardware.
- **Compare execution providers precisely.** Analyzer output reports detected pattern counts per EP because pattern sources and deduplication can differ by provider.
- **Drill into the details.** Deep insights into operator compatibility, shape mismatches, graph optimizations, and EP-aware tuning at any stage of the pipeline.
- **AI-ready.** CLI-driven tools with built-in skills, friendly to work with mainstream agents.

## What you get out of the box

- **All Windows ML EPs supported.** Every [supported execution provider](https://microsoft.github.io/winml-cli/latest/concepts/eps-and-devices/#eps-winml-cli-supports) is available behind the same commands.
- **Curated model catalog.** A [verified set of models](https://microsoft.github.io/winml-cli/latest/reference/supported-models/) that run across all Windows ML EPs - a reliable starting point.
- **Bring your own ONNX.** Not only for converting from PyTorch - bring an [existing ONNX model](https://microsoft.github.io/winml-cli/latest/tutorials/build-from-onnx/) to get operator-compatibility insights and optimize it based on the analysis.
- **Hub-hosted ONNX models.** Reference pre-exported ONNX files on the Hugging Face Hub as `<org>/<repo>/<path/to/file>.onnx` (e.g. `onnx-community/sam3-tracker-ONNX/onnx/vision_encoder_int8.onnx`). Supported by `winml config`, `winml build`, `winml run`, `winml serve`, `winml perf`, and `winml eval`.

## 🎯 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Windows | Windows 11 24H2 or later (required for NPU support; earlier versions work for CPU/GPU) |
| Python | 3.11 |
| Package manager | [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) |
| WinML CLI | [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/winml-cli/) |

### Installation

WinML CLI requires **Python 3.11** and is distributed as a Python wheel. We recommend [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast, reproducible environment setup.

> **Windows on Arm:** winml-cli supports **x64 (AMD64) Python only**. On an Arm64 device, install an x64 build of Python 3.11 so `uv` resolves the `win_amd64` wheels — PyTorch and the Windows ML runtime packages publish no `win_arm64` wheels, so native Arm64 Python fails during setup. The x64 interpreter runs under Windows emulation and works normally. Create the environment with an explicit x64 interpreter:
>
> ```powershell
> uv python install cpython-3.11-windows-x86_64-none
> uv venv --python cpython-3.11-windows-x86_64-none
> ```

**1. Create an environment**

```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
```

Activate it:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Windows (Git Bash / WSL)
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

**2. Install winml-cli**

```bash
uv pip install winml-cli
```

**3. Verify your environment**

```bash
uv run winml sys --list-device --list-ep
```

This command enumerates available compute devices and execution providers on your machine. If an expected device or execution provider is missing, `winml sys` is the right place to diagnose it. See [winml sys](https://microsoft.github.io/winml-cli/latest/commands/sys/) for the full flag reference and troubleshooting tips.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Inspect the model

Before downloading any models, confirm that winml-cli recognises the model:

```bash
uv run winml inspect -m microsoft/resnet-50
```

💡 Tip: Always inspect before build to catch unsupported architectures early.

### Build the model

```bash
uv run winml build -m microsoft/resnet-50 -o resnet_out/ --no-quant
```

`winml build` runs all pipeline steps in sequence — export, optimize, quantize. You can start a model build without a config file, or provide one to configure each step in the sequence (see [`winml config`](https://microsoft.github.io/winml-cli/latest/commands/config/) to customize). All intermediate artifacts land in `resnet_out/`. For more details, see [Output Layout - Windows ML CLI](https://microsoft.github.io/winml-cli/latest/reference/output-layout/#file-categories).

### Benchmark the model

```bash
uv run winml perf -m resnet_out/model.onnx --device auto --iterations 50 --monitor
```

`--device auto` lets the CLI resolve the best available device on your machine — NPU first, then GPU, then CPU.

## 🔒 Privacy & Telemetry

Official WinML CLI releases can collect **unlinked pseudonymized** usage telemetry
to help improve the product. Telemetry is classified as **Optional**. A one-time
prompt on your first run asks for consent (default: accept — press **Enter** to
enable, type `n` to decline).

**Control** — edit `%USERPROFILE%\.winml\config.json`:

- Set `telemetry.consent` to `"disabled"` to opt out
- Set `telemetry.consent` to `"enabled"` to opt in
- Delete the file to re-show the first-run prompt on the next run

See [docs/Privacy.md](docs/Privacy.md) for the full list of what is and is not
collected, event schemas, CI auto-disable behavior, and storage locations.
