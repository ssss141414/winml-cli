# Contributing

We're always looking for your help to improve the product (bug fixes, new features, documentation, etc).

## Contribute a code change

* Start by reading the project [README](./README.md) to understand the scope and goals of WinML CLI.
* If your change is non-trivial or introduces new public facing APIs, please use the [feature request issue template](https://github.com/microsoft/winml-cli/issues/new) to discuss it with the team first.
* For all other changes, you can directly create a pull request (PR) and we'll be happy to take a look.
* Make sure your PR adheres to the coding conventions and standards below.

## Getting started

See the [README](./README.md#getting-started) for prerequisites and installation instructions. Then set up your development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/winml-cli.git
cd winml-cli
uv sync --locked
uv run pre-commit install
```

This installs all dependencies and enables [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) that automatically check license headers, formatting (Ruff), trailing whitespace, and YAML syntax on every commit.

### Runtime check rules

When running WinML CLI from a source tree (`uv run winml ...`), you need to populate the runtime check rule zips locally. See [`src/winml/modelkit/analyze/rules/runtime_check_rules/README.md`](./src/winml/modelkit/analyze/rules/runtime_check_rules/README.md) for setup options (GitHub release for external contributors, `gim-home` script for Microsoft internal, `WINMLCLI_RULES_DIR` override).

For external contributors, download from a GitHub release:

```bash
gh release download <tag> --repo microsoft/winml-cli --pattern 'rules-v*.zip' --dir .
Expand-Archive -Path .\rules-v*.zip -DestinationPath src\winml\modelkit\analyze\rules\runtime_check_rules -Force
```

## Coding conventions and standards

### Python code style

Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [Google's Python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). A maximum line length of 100 characters is enforced.

This project uses the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **Ruff** for linting and formatting
- **Mypy** for type checking
- **Pytest** for testing

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure:

```bash
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
uv run ruff format src/ tests/
uv run mypy src/
uv run pytest tests/
```

### Testing

New code *must* be accompanied by unit tests. Code coverage should aim at maintaining over 80% coverage.

### License header

All Python source files **must** include the MIT license header at the top of the file:

```python
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
# Licensed under the MIT License.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The pre-commit hook configured in [Getting started](#getting-started) will automatically insert this header on new `.py` files.
